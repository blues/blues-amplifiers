## Resources

- [Presentation In-a-Box](/presentation) - this is a canned presentation that 
  provides a high-level overview of Blues, the Notecard, and Notehub. It's 
  useful on its own or as a starting point when giving a talk about Blues.
- [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible) 
  and [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) are the two 
  primary fonts used throughout the Blues-provided resources.
